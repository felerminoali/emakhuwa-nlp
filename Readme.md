**Emakhuwa Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tools and Data**


Welcome to the **Emakhuwa** Natural Language Processing (NLP) repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive collection of tools, resources, and data for NLP tasks specifically tailored to the Emakhuwa language.

  

**About Emakhuwa**

  

Emakhuwa is a Bantu language spoken by the Emakhuwa people primarily in Mozambique, with a significant number of speakers in Tanzania, Malawi, and Zimbabwe. It is one of the most widely spoken languages in Mozambique and plays a crucial role in the cultural and linguistic diversity of the region.

  
  

**Project Structure**

This repository is organized into the following sections:

 - **Data**: This directory contains various datasets for Emakhuwa NLP tasks. These datasets are curated and collected specifically for
   training and evaluation purposes.
   
   **Preprocessing**: In this section, you will find preprocessing scripts and utilities to help you clean, normalize, and tokenize
   Emakhuwa text data. These tools are designed to prepare the data for
   further NLP tasks.
   
   **Language Models**: Here, you can access pretrained language models specifically fine-tuned for Emakhuwa language. These models can be
   used for tasks like text classification, named entity recognition,
   sentiment analysis, and more.
   
   **Word Embeddings**: This section provides pre-trained word embeddings for Emakhuwa language. These embeddings capture semantic
   and syntactic information about words, which can be used as features
   for downstream NLP tasks.
   
   **Evaluation Metrics**: In this directory, you will find evaluation scripts and metrics tailored for Emakhuwa NLP tasks. These tools will
   assist you in measuring the performance of your models and
   algorithms.
   
   **Resources**: This section contains additional resources, such as dictionaries, grammars, and linguistic references, which can be
   helpful in developing Emakhuwa-specific NLP applications.
